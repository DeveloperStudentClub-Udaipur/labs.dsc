# [Developer Student Clubs Project Website](https://developerstudentclub-udaipur.github.io/labs.dsc/)

This is an experimental initiative by Akshay Nandwana, where we are collecting all the projects developed under global DSC Leads and showcase them on this website. These projects are developed by DSC Leads and their student teams to help local businesses around them.
- If you are a DSC Lead, submit the project link which you had developed with your team via [Google Form](https://goo.gl/D8e3Ex)
- If you are not a DSC Lead, find the project in which you are interested and we will connect you with the respective DSC lead to start contributing on their project and run them in your city as well. 

Our goal on making this repository is to help students across DSC's to find projects, ideas and to increase the interaction level between students on a global level.
